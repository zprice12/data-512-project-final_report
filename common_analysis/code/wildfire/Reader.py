class Reader(object):
    '''
    
    This class implements a simple streaming reader that is compatible with the GeoJSON data formats for the
    wildfire datasets provided by the USGS. One example of that data can be found at:
    
    https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81
    
    The Reader class provides the public methods:
        open()    - to open the named GeoJson file
        header()  - to return the descriptive information for the dataset
        next()    - to get, one at a time, each GeoJSON feature from the file
        rewind()  - to return the file to the start of the GeoJSON features
        close()   - to close the file
        
    The class will attempt to maintain consistency of the Reader and will throw exceptions to attempt to prevent
    some incosistent operations.
    
    A new object can be created and initialized, and have the file opened in one shot
    
        reader = Reader("file_to_read.json")
    
    This would initialize the reader and open the file, making the file read to read each of the GeoJSON features
    using something like 'reader.next()'. An alternate idiom would be two lines
    
        reader = Reader()
        reader.open("file_to_read.json")

    #   fields occur *before* the list of features. This works for the USGS wildfire dataset.
